# RedisBungee fork By Limework
The original project of RedisBungee is no longer maintained, so we have forked the plugin.

RedisBungee uses [Redis](https://redis.io) with Java client [Jedis](https://github.com/redis/jedis/) 
to Synchronize players data between [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) or [Velocity*](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity) proxies

Velocity*: *version 3.1.2 or above is only supported, any version below that might work but might be unstable* [#40](https://github.com/ProxioDev/RedisBungee/pull/40)

## compatibility with original RedisBungee in Bungeecord ecosystem
This fork ensures compatibility with old plugins, so it should work as drop replacement,
but since Api has been split from the platform there some changes that have to be done, so your plugin might not work if:

* there is none at the moment, please report any findings at the issue page.

Cluster mode compatibility in version 0.8.0:

If you are using static legacy method `RedisBungee#getPool()` it might fail in:
* if Cluster mode is enabled, due fact its Uses different classes
* if JedisPool compatibility mode is disabled in the config due fact project internally switched to JedisPooled than Jedis
*

## Implementing RedisBungee in your plugin: [![RedisBungee Build](https://github.com/proxiodev/RedisBungee/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Limework/RedisBungee/actions/workflows/maven.yml) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/ProxioDev/redisbungee.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#ProxioDev/redisbungee)

RedisBungee is distributed as a [maven](https://maven.apache.org) project.

By using jitpack [![](https://jitpack.io/v/ProxioDev/redisbungee.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#ProxioDev/redisbungee)

## Setup jitpack repository
```xml
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```
## [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)
add this in your project dependencies 
```xml
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.ddos_ling.redisbungee</groupId>
	    <artifactId>RedisBungee-Bungee</artifactId>
	    <version>VERSION</version>
	    <scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>
	
```
then in your project plugin.yml add `RedisBungee` to `depends` like this
```yaml
name: "yourplugin"
main: your.main.class
version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
author: idk
depends: [ RedisBungee ]
```


## [Velocity](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity)

	    <artifactId>RedisBungee-Velocity</artifactId>
	    <version>VERSION</version>
	    <scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>
```
then to make your plugin depends on RedisBungee, make sure your plugin class Annotation have `@Dependency(id = "redisbungee")` like this
```java
@Plugin(
  id = "myplugin",
  name = "My Plugin",
  version = "0.1.0-beta",
  dependencies = {
    @Dependency(id = "redisbungee")
  }
)
public class PluginMainClass {

}
```
